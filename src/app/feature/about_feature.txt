We are going to create multiple feature modules for every independent feature of our application. 

Feature modules should only import services from CoreModule.

If feature module A needs to import service from feature module B consider moving that service into core.

Rule of thumb is to try to create features which don’t depend on any other features just on services provided by CoreModule and components provided by SharedModule.

This will keep our code clean, easy to maintain and extend with new features. It also reduces effort needed for refactoring. 

If followed properly, then that changes to one feature can’t affect or break the rest of our application.
